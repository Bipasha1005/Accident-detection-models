# 🚧 Accident Detection Models using AI

An AI-powered system designed to detect road accidents in real-time using computer vision, audio analysis, and sensor data. This project aims to reduce emergency response time and enhance road safety by automatically identifying accident scenarios.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains machine learning and deep learning models trained to detect accidents based on:
- **Video feeds (dashcam or CCTV)**
- **Audio cues (e.g., crashes, skids)**
- **Sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope)**

The models can trigger alerts or notifications to emergency services, making it ideal for integration into smart traffic systems, surveillance networks, or vehicle safety solutions.

- 🎥 **YOLOv5 / SSD-Based Visual Detection**
- 🎙️ **Audio Event Detection using Librosa + CNN**
- 📱 **Sensor Data-Based ML Model (SVM, Random Forest)**
- 📡 **Instant Alert Trigger via API (Twilio / Firebase / etc.)**
- 📊 **Dashboard-ready outputs for control rooms or emergency teams**
